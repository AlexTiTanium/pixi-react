import { EmbeddedEditor } from '@site/src/components/Editor/EmbeddedEditor';
import ExampleApp from '!!raw-loader!../src/examples/basic/App';
import ExampleBunnySprite from '!!raw-loader!../src/examples/basic/BunnySprite';
import ExampleCreateApplication from '!!raw-loader!../src/examples/basic/CreateApplicationExample';

To add `@pixi/react` to an existing React application, install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install pixi.js@^8.2.6 @pixi/react@beta
```

## Does it have limitations?

None. Everything that works in Pixi.js will work here without exception.

{/* ## Is it slower than plain Threejs? */}
{/* No. There is no overhead. Components render outside of React. It outperforms Threejs in scale due to React's scheduling abilities. */}

## Can it keep up with frequent feature updates to Pixi.js?
Yes. `@pixi/react` is a thin wrapper around Pixi.js, allowing it to be expressed via JSX. For example, `<pixiSprite>` is backed by a Pixi.js [`Sprite`][pixi-sprite]. If a feature is added, removed, or changed in Pixi.js, those changes will be available to you without updating `@pixi/react`.

## What does it look like?

Let's make a reusable component that has its own state, reacts to user-input and participates in the render-loop:

<EmbeddedEditor
    files={{
        'App.js': ExampleApp,
        'BunnySprite.js': ExampleBunnySprite,
        'CreateApplicationExample.js': ExampleCreateApplication,
    }}
    viewType={'both'}
    width={'100%'} />
