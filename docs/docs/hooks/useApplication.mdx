`useApplication` allows access to the parent `PIXI.Application` created by the `<Application>` component. This hook _will not work_ outside of an `<Application>` component. Additionally, the parent application is passed via [React Context][react-useContext]. This means `useApplication` will only work appropriately in _child components_, and in the same component that creates the `<Application>`.

For example, the following example `useApplication` **will not** be able to access the parent application:

```jsx
import {
    Application,
    useApplication,
} from '@pixi/react';

const MyComponent = () => {
    // This will cause an invariant violation.
    const { app } = useApplication();

    return <Application />;
};
```

Here's a working example where `useApplication` **will** be able to access the parent application:

```jsx
import {
    Application,
    useApplication,
} from '@pixi/react';

const ChildComponent = () => {
    const { app } = useApplication();

    return <container />;
};

const MyComponent = () => (
    <Application>
        <ChildComponent />
    </Application>
);
```
