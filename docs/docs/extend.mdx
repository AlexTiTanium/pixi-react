One of the most important concepts to understand with v8 is `extend`. Normally `@pixi/react` would have to import all pf Pixi.js to be able to provide the full library as JSX components. Instead, we use an internal catalogue of components populated by the `extend` API. This allows you to define exactly which parts of Pixi.js you want to import, keeping your bundle sizes small.

To allow `@pixi/react` to use a Pixi.js component, pass it to the `extend` API:

<EmbeddedEditor
    files={{
        'App.js': {
            code: ExampleApp,
            active: true,
        }
    }}
    viewType={'editor'}
    width={'100%'} />

## ⚠️ WARNING ⚠️
Attempting to use components that haven't been passed to the [`extend`][extend] API **will result in errors**.

[extend]: /extend
